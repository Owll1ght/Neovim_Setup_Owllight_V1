This is my neovim setup I save in a repository, using Lazy Nvim for my package manager. I haven't added LSP at the current version (v0.9 tag when I write this) so the autocomplete only helps for function names or other texts that I've written before.

This repo and project is an ongoing project, where when I find new ways to configure my editor and I feel like it can help, I'll add it.
